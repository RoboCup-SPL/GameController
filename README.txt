This is the GameController developed by team B-Human for the RoboCup SPL and Humanoid-League.

If there are any question, please contact yuzong@informatik.uni-bremen.de .


########## 1. Building from Source ##########

To build it from the source code you may use Apache Ant.
There are some ant targets:

- clean
	cleans up the project folder

- compile
	compiles the code and stores files in /build/classes
	
- jar
	creates a jar package and stores it in /build/jar

	
########## 2. Executing the Jar ##########

Double-click GameController.jar or run 

Usage: java -jar GameController.jar {options}
  (-h | --help)                   display help
  (-b | --broadcast) <address>    set broadcast ip (default is 255.255.255.255)
  (-l | --league) (spl | hl_kid | hl_teen | hl_adult)
                                  select league (default is spl)
  (-w | --window)                 select window mode (default is fullscreen)


########## 3. Usage ##########

## Start Dialog ##

Select your league. The default can be specified as a command line parameter (see above).

Pick the two teams that are playing. They have to be different teams. If you are practicing alone, use the "Invisibles" as second team.

SPL: You also have to select whether you play a game in the preliminaries or a play-off game. In the preliminaries the clock will continue to run during game stoppages and there will be no penalties shootout in case of a draw.

HL: You also have to select whether you play a normal game or a knock-out game. A knock-out game will continue after a draw with two halves of extra time (if goals were scored before) and then a penalty shoot-out if necessary. 

You can select whether the GameController should run in fullscreen mode or in windowed mode. Note that the fullscreen mode does not work correctly on some Linux desktops, because although they report to Java that they would support this feature, they do not.

You can also select whether teams exchange their colors in the halftime.


## Main Screen ##

The use of the main screen should be rather obvious in most cases. Therefore, we only focus on the specialties.

When ever you made a mistake, use the undo history at the bottom of the screen to correct it. You cannot correct individual decisions (except for the last one). Instead, you can only roll back to a certain state of the game. Click the oldest decision in the history you want to undo. After that all decisions that would be undone will be marked. Click the decision again to actually undo it together with all decisions that followed. 

To penalize a robot, first press the penalty button, then the robot button. For unpenalizing a robot, just press the robot button. A robot can only be unpenalized, when its penalty time is over or when the game state changes (SPL only). Five seconds before the penalty time is over, the robot's button starts flashing yellow. For regular penalties, it continues to flash until the button is pressed. Only buttons of robots that were requested for pickup stop flashing after five seconds and simply stay yellow until they are pressed, as a reminder that the robot can return as soon as it is ready.

Before unpenalizing a robot, please make sure that it was put back on the field by the assistant referees. For that reason, robots are never unpenalized automatically.

HL: To substitute a robot, press "Substitute" and then the robot that should leave the field. Afterwards, any of the substitutes can be be activated.

When pressing "+" (goal), "Timeout", "Kickoff Goal", or "Global Game Stuck", the other team gets the next kick-off. "Kickoff Goal" and "Global Game Stuck" share the same button.


########## 4. Shortcuts ##########

While the GameController is running, you may use the following keys on the keyboard instead of pushing buttons:

Esc		- press it twice to close the GameController2
Delete		- toggle test-mode (everything is legal, every button is visible and enabled)
Backspace	- undo last action

only SPL
B	- out by blue
R	- out by red

P	- pushing
L	- leaving the field
F	- fallen robot
I	- inactive robot
D	- illegal defender
O	- ball holding
H	- playing with hands
U	- request for pickup

only Humanoid-League
C	- out by cyan
M	- out by magenta

B	- ball manipulation
P	- physical contact
A	- illegal attack
D	- illegal defense
R	- service / incapable
S	- substitute


########## 5. libgamectrl (SPL) ##########

libgamectrl automatically provides the GameController packets in ALMemory. It also implements the return channel of the GameController. It handles the buttons and LEDs according to the rules (with a few additions).


## Installation ##

Put the file libgamectrl.so somewhere on your NAO and add the library to your file "autoload.ini" so that NAOqi can find it. 

It is also possible to build the library from source using Aldebaran's qibuild framework. The qiproject.xml and CMakeList.txt have been placed in libgamectrl's source folder. Just follow the instructions of the README file there.


## Usage ##

In your NAOqi module, execute the follow code at the beginning (only once):

AL::ALMemoryProxy *memory = new AL::ALMemoryProxy(pBroker);
memory->insertData("GameCtrl/teamNumber", <your team number>);
memory->insertData("GameCtrl/teamColour", <your default team color>);
memory->insertData("GameCtrl/playerNumber", <your robot's player number>);

The team number must be non-zero. Setting the team number will reset libgamectrl (e.g. go back to the initial state). libgamectrl will also set "GameCtrl/teamNumber" back to zero, so it recognize the next time your application is started.

You can receive the current GameController packet with:

RoboCupGameControlData gameCtrlData; // should probably zero it the first time it is used
AL::ALValue value = memory->getData("GameCtrl/RoboCupGameControlData");
if(value.isBinary() && value.getSize() == sizeof(RoboCupGameControlData))
  memcpy(&gameControlData, value, sizeof(RoboCupGameControlData));


## Deviations from the Rules ##

The first time the chest button is pressed it is ignored, because many teams will use it to let the robot get up.

In the Initial state, it is also possible to switch between "normal", "penalty taker" (green LED), and "penalty goalkeeper" (yellow LED) by pressing the right foot bumper. The state is shown by the right foot LED, and only in the Initial state. An active GameController will overwrite these settings.


########## 6. Misc ##########

The format of the packets the GameController broadcasts and receives is defined in the file RoboCupGameControlData.h, which is identical to the one that was used in 2012, except for the introduction of a new penalty constant that tells a robot that it is a substitute. This penalty is currently only used in the HL.
